<h1>Customized Linux</h1>
Did you use Linux From Scratch? It's awesome! It was a dream of mine to complete, 
and after a long time, I finally did it. It's really, really good, and I recommend 
it to any Sysadmin who wants to learn more. The reason I didn't continue with it 
is that maintenance afterwards is very complicated. With a community behind it, 
it's obviously much easier and more fun. For that very reason, it remained an experience.
<br />
However, the good thing is that it gave me all the knowledge necessary to customize 
other versions, and that's how I was able to complete another project I had in 
mind: a bootable USB Linux distro for a computer without a hard drive to use as a Firewall.
<br />
Another similar project is a 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13nXQFm83Wd-N2XAzbImKgjjmu2V5jF-K/view?usp=sharing">Zoom distro</a>. 
I couldn't find one, and this way I can 
boot any computer with the pendrive and have Zoom without needing to install it. 
Easy and practical, portable for conferences wherever, whenever!
