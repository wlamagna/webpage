<h1>Android</h1>
I remember when I was 14 or 15, how difficult it was to access information. 
Books were so expensive you almost had to steal them! (Just kidding!) Today is a 
paradise in that sense; you can find books to learn almost anything.
<br />
<br />
<b>The Problem</b>: One day, I was windsurfing on the river, and I had my cell phone in 
a waterproof bag. Unfortunately, due to a bit of fatigue and a bit of unfamiliarity, 
the phone holder broke, and it fell to the bottom of the river. 
Despite my attempts, I couldn't find it > a truly sad situation.<br />
<br />
<b>The Solution:</b>
Today, cell phones are big, and their batteries can't be removed. On the other hand, 
I have a cell phone saved from 10 years ago, a mini-computer! The power of these 
little devices is impressive, and many are kept unused even though they still have 
potential. I had a Samsung I5500; it came with Android 2.2, but with CyanogenMod, 
I had upgraded it to 2.3. Using the Eclipse SDK, I was able to open some old 
projects and create a small program that records GPS coordinates. 
The phone is small and fits in a life vest pocket, so I can at least record 
the coordinates and then visualize where I've been navigating.

And working with GPS data, using <a href="https://activityworkshop.net/software/gpsprune/" target=_new>GPSPrune</a>, 
a really good utility from Linux. Here's an example route through <a href="06-06-2021-034415gps.gps">Sarmiento Park</a>.
<br />
For now, the program stores the date/time, latitude, longitude, and altitude on a micro SD card within the device. After that, you just need to mount it and open it with GPSPrune, for instance.
