<h1>Welcome!</h1>
This page will be where I attempt to organize projects of interest. I've gained so much knowledge from others, and now I want to make my own contribution as a way to return the favor.

Mi <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-lamagna/" target="_new">Linkedin</a>,
<a href="https://x.com/WalterLamagna" target="_new">Twitter</a>, 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/walmagna/" target="_new">Instagram</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/wlamagna" target="_new">Github</a>.
<br /><br />
As I'm passionate about IT, I decided to study <a href="ingeniero.html">Systems Engineering</a> at UAI. 
My second significant investment 
was a <a href="cert/">SUN Solaris SCSA certification</a>, which formalized my experience as a Unix SysAdmin/SysOp. 
Later, during my time at IBM, I pursued a <a href="dm/es_index.html">Master's in Data Mining (Data Science) at UBA</a>, where 
I earned my Master's degree with my thesis, "Artificial Reading of Handwritten Numbers in 
Open Data from Legislative Elections in the City of Buenos Aires."
