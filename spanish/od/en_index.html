Open data means a passion for the possibilities and opportunities it
represents.  The concept of open data is something that always existed
since the spirit of sharing data and useful relevent infomation with
other people who can take these data to the next level.<br /><br />

Here some personal and voluntary research, motivated by the legally and technically freedom
of using these data, i personally interpret it as relevant and interesting, either to take a
decision or just like anectotic for a coffee talk.<br /><br />

relationship between actors that work together.<br /><br />
